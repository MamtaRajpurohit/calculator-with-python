# Python Calculator

A simple Python-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides one number by another (handles division by zero)
  
## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd python-calculator
   ```

3. **Run the Python script**:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

   The calculator will ask for your input and show the result of the operation you choose.

## Usage Example

After running the script, you will be prompted to select an operation (Addition, Subtraction, etc.) and enter two numbers. For example:

```
Welcome to the Calculator!
Select an operation:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5): 1
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
The result is: 8.0
```

## Future Enhancements
- **Additional operations**: Modulus, exponentiation, and more.
- **GUI**: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter` for a more interactive experience.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for invalid inputs (non-numeric inputs, etc.).
- **History Feature**: Keep track of previous calculations in a log.
